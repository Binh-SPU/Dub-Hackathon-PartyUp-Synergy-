* Real-time Validation: Perform validation in real-time as users enter data, providing immediate feedback.
* Submission Validation: Ensure that the form is only submitted when all data passes validation criteria.

**2. Page Form with Formik:**
* Form Components: Create form components for various sections of your app.
* Form State Management: Manage form state and user input, making it easy to track and update the form data.
* Dynamic Forms: Enable dynamic forms that adapt to the specific needs of each page or section, including optional and required fields.
  
**3. Tab Navigation with React Native Navigation:**

* Tab Switching: Allow users to switch between tabs by tapping on the associated icons or labels in the tab bar.

## Potential Improvements
1. Offline Mode: Develop an offline mode that allows users to access essential features and browse for parties even when they are not connected to the internet.
2. User Profiles: Users can create detailed profiles, showcasing their gaming preferences, skill levels, and gaming history. These profiles help in effective party-finding, ensuring that players team up with individuals who share similar interests and skills.
3. Notifications: The app sends timely notifications to users about party invitations, messages, and updates related to the games they are interested in.
